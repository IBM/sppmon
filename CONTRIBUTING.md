## Create an GitHub issue

While GitHub does not make issues mandatory, it is a good idea to use them.  It creates a space for discussions, and also provides tracking of all activity surrounding the work.

* Navigate to [https://github.com/IBM/spectrum-protect-sppmon/issues/new](https://github.com/IBM/spectrum-protect-sppmon/issues/new)
* Select an appropriate title
* Enter a description, if applicable.
* Take note of the issue number, it will be used later.

### Requesting / Implementing Features

To request or implement a feature, please open an issue.
This issue should contain:

* Meaningful title
* What is the goal / intention of your feature request?
* Description of your solution or result
* Alternatives or other features which are considerable
* Additional context if applicable

We will assign the Label `enhancement` to it.

### Reporting Bugs

If you've encountered a bug, please check first our [wiki](https://github.com/IBM/spectrum-protect-sppmon/wiki) and [FAQ](https://github.com/IBM/spectrum-protect-sppmon/wiki/Frequently-asked-Questions) for a solution or workaround.
If you cant find any, please open a issue.
This issue should contain:

* A meaningful title, including the prefix `BUG:`
* Clear and concise description of what the bug is
* Steps to reproduce
* Expected behavior
* Screenshots if applicable
* System information
* Additional context if applicable

We will assign the Label `bug` to it.

## Contributing Code

To contribute code please check out the [Developers Guide](TODO).
We are using Issues and Pull requests to implement new features and fix bugs.
Please create an issue first, then fork and open a pull request, linking to your issue.

### Fork this repository

In GitHub, all work is typically done in a "fork". The fork is a private copy of the main repository. All changes will be published to the main repository once they have been reviewed and accepted by a main repository owner.

* Click on the "Fork" button in the top left area of the page.
* This will create and navigate you to a private copy of this repository (notice the URL is slightly different from the main repository).
* This is where all the work will be done, and reviewed before getting pulled/published to the main repository.

### Create a Pull request

Once you are happy with the of your work and want to publish it, you will need to create a "Pull request". This is where the SPPmon team will have a chance to review the changes before accepting them into the public repository.

* Navigate to your fork.
* Switch to the "Pull requests" tab.
* Click the "New pull request" button.
* Click the "Create pull request" button.
* In the title, reference the issue number, prefixed with a pound sign.
* Optionally add comments.
* Click the "Create pull request".
* We will receive a notification, do the review and eventually accept the pull request into the main repository.

## Coding Standards

Please refer to our [IDE and coding recommendations] when implementing new features.
We are using Visual Studio Code, including:

* Pylance 
* Python Docstring
