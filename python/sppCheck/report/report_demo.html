<h3> Set up Check </h3>

<caption>
    This table shows the overview of all supported metrics displaying setup-check statistics. <br/>

    <br/>
    A value <span style="color:green">above 100%</span> means that the currently available space <span style="color:green">is higher</span> than required. <br/>

    Please refer to the sections below for a more detailed explanation and view. <br/>
    <br/>
    Please be aware that even if a value below 100% is shown, the system can run correctly - it is just designed smaller than initial anticipated. <br />
    However, this also works the other way around: A correct setup does not promise that the system will last the whole anticipated life-cycle.  <br />

<h3 id="bla"> Server Memory Report </h3>

<h4> Full Life-Cycle Overview </h4>
<img src="Server Memory Report_full_graph.png" alt="Server Memory Report_full_graph.png" width="1000" height="500">
<h5> Panel description </h5>
<p>

This report shows the development of the <span style="color:blue">used</span>, <span style="color:purple">available</span> and <span style="color:orange">recommended</span> Server Memory. <br />
The Graphs display the entire life cycle from 2020-07-02 to 2026-07-23.  <br />

</p>
<h5> Value meaning </h5>
<p>
    The <span style="color:purple">purple line</span> represents the <span style="color:purple">currently available</span> space, while the <span style="color:blue">blue line</span> represents the <span style="color:blue">used</span> space. <br />
    Therefore, the point where the <span style="color:red">lines cross</span> is the date where the system will <span style="color:red">fail</span>. <br />
    This assumes that the available space is not increased any further, since this requires a manual interaction. <br />
    The point of failure can be delayed by increasing the available space. <br />
    However, if the lines never cross, the space can be reduced accordingly. <br />
    A prediction function is used to forecast the trend for the systems remaining life cycle after the current date (2022-08-05). <br/>
    <br />

The <span style="color:orange">orange line</span> represents the recommended space. <br />
This is the space recommended according to the Blueprint vSnap Sizer sheets for the system to last until this day. <br />
If the <span style="color:blue">blue line</span> is below this line, the system is developing <span style="color:green">slower</span> than anticipated. <br />
However, if the <span style="color:blue">blue line</span> is above the <span style="color:orange">orange line</span>, the system is developing <span style="color:red">quicker</span> than anticipated. <br />

</p>

<h4> One-Year Summary </h4>
<img src="Server Memory Report_one_year_used.png" alt="Server Memory Report_one_year_used.png" width="1000" height="500">
<h5> Panel description </h5>
<p>

This report shows the anticipated free Server Memory and the expected usage percentage relative to the available memory. <br />
All values are taken from the prediction graph, limited to the following year.  <br />
The Graphs display the range from now - 1 to now + 1 year. <br />

</p>

<h5> Value meaning </h5>
<p>
    A <span style="color:green"> positive value </span> means that space is still <span style="color:green">free</span> after one year. <br />
    A <span style="color:red">negative value</span> indicates the expected minimum value by which the <span style="color:red">capacity must be upgraded</span>. <br />
    The percent values are displayed to allow an impression of the value to total ratio. <br />
</p>

<h4> Setup-Check </h4>
<img src="Server Memory Report_full_excel.png" alt="Server Memory Report_full_excel.png" width="1000" height="500">
<h5> Panel description </h5>
<p>

This report shows the currently existing Server Memory relative to the recommended Memory according to the Blueprint vSnap Sizer sheets at the end of the system lifetime. <br />
All values are taken from the prediction graph of the system's entire life cycle. <br />
The Graphs display the entire life cycle from 2020-07-02 to 2026-07-23.  <br />

</p>

<h5> Value meaning </h5>
<p>
    A <span style="color:green">positive value</span> means the system was set up with <span style="color:green">more space than recommended</span> by the Sizer sheet. <br />
    A <span style="color:red">negative value</span> indicates the <span style="color:red">difference required</span> to reach the recommended size of the Sizer sheets. <br />
    <br />
    Even if this Panels shows a negative value, the system can run correctly - it is just designed smaller than initial anticipated. <br />
    However, this also works the other way around:  <br />
    A correct setup does not promise that the system will last the whole anticipated life-cycle.  <br />

<h3> Storage Report </h3>

<h4> Full Life-Cycle Overview </h4>
<img src="Storage Report_full_graph.png" alt="Storage Report_full_graph.png" width="1000" height="500">
<h5> Panel description </h5>
<p>

This report shows the development of the <span style="color:blue">used</span>, <span style="color:purple">available</span> and recommended Storage space <span style="color:red">with</span> and <span style="color:orange">without reserve</span>. <br />
For this prediction, the values of all individual vSnaps are summarized into a single statistic. <br/>
The Graphs display the entire life cycle from 2020-07-02 to 2026-07-23.  <br />

</p>
<h5> Value meaning </h5>
<p>
    The <span style="color:purple">purple line</span> represents the <span style="color:purple">currently available</span> space, while the <span style="color:blue">blue line</span> represents the <span style="color:blue">used</span> space. <br />
    Therefore, the point where the <span style="color:red">lines cross</span> is the date where the system will <span style="color:red">fail</span>. <br />

    The point of failure can be delayed by increasing the available space. <br />
    However, if the lines never cross, the space can be reduced accordingly. <br />
    A prediction function is used to forecast the trend for the systems remaining life cycle after the current date (2022-08-05). <br/>
    <br />

The <span style="color:red">red line</span> represents the recommended space with reserve, with the <span style="color:orange">orange line</span> omits the reserve. <br />
This is the space required according to the Blueprint vSnap Sizer sheets for the system to last until this day. <br />
If the <span style="color:blue">blue line</span> is below these lines, the system is developing <span style="color:green">slower</span> than anticipated. <br />
If it is between these lines, it is developing just as expected. <br />
However, if the <span style="color:blue">blue line</span> is above the <span style="color:red">red line</span>, the system is developing <span style="color:red">quicker</span> than anticipated. <br />

<h5> Value meaning </h5>
<p>
    The <span style="color:blue">blue line</span> represents the <span style="color:blue">currently existing</span> systems.
    The <span style="color:orange">orange line</span> represents the recommended count of systems. <br />
    This is the count recommended according to the Blueprint vSnap Sizer sheets for the SPP-System to last until its end of life cycle. <br />
